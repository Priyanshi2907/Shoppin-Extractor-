# 3.2. Cost Analysis

This section outlines the estimated operational costs for scaling the Shopify Size Chart Extractor service across thousands of e-commerce stores, identifies key cost drivers, and proposes strategies for cost optimization.

---

## Cost Projections

We assume:

* Each store has \~100 product pages.
* Each product page has one size chart.
* The scraper is run **once per month** per store.
* Size chart extraction uses both HTML parsing and image OCR (via Tesseract or Playwright where required).
* Infrastructure is hosted on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
* Proxy/IP rotation is required for anti-bot bypassing.

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| **Scale** | **Stores** | **Pages Crawled** | **OCR Images** | **Estimated Monthly Cost (USD)** |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Small     | 1,000      | 100,000           | \~50,000       | \~\$150–\$300                    |
| Medium    | 10,000     | 1,000,000         | \~500,000      | \~\$1,200–\$2,000                |
| Large     | 100,000    | 10,000,000        | \~5,000,000    | \~\$10,000–\$20,000+             |

**Breakdown for 10,000 stores:**

| **Service**                   | **Usage**                          | **Monthly Cost**      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Cloud Compute (EC2/VPS)       | Parallel scraping (x10–20 servers) | \$400–800             |
| Proxy Services/IP Rotation    | Residential proxies, 1M+ requests  | \$400–600             |
| Storage (S3/GCS)              | Product + image data (10–20 GB)    | \$30–50               |
| Tesseract OCR + Image I/O     | CPU-intensive OCR at scale         | \$200–400             |
| Monitoring/Logging (optional) | Logs + alerts + dashboards         | \$50–100              |
| **Total**                     |                                    | **\~\$1,200–\$2,000** |

## Cost Drivers

1. **Compute Resources**

   * Fast scraping + OCR (Playwright or Tesseract) consumes CPU and RAM.
   * Dynamic pages and browser rendering increase resource demand.

2. **Proxy/IP Rotation**

   * Most Shopify stores use bot protection (Cloudflare, Akamai).
   * Reliable residential or rotating proxy services (e.g., Bright Data, ScraperAPI) are required.

3. **OCR Processing**

   * Images (size charts) processed using Tesseract or other OCR tools consume significant CPU time.
   * Accuracy can require image preprocessing.

4. **Storage**

   * Storing product metadata, images, OCR JSON, and historical snapshots.
   * Grows linearly with number of stores.

5. **Bandwidth and Requests**

   * Web requests for HTML + image content can spike during large scraping runs.
   * Outbound traffic from proxy services also adds cost.

## Cost Reduction Strategy

### 1. Smart Task Scheduling

* Spread scraping jobs across the month.
* Avoid peak hours to reduce proxy usage cost and detection risk.
* Batch stores by region/time zone to optimize latency.

### 2. Use Static Scraping Where Possible

* Prioritize using static scraping (requests + lxml) before falling back to Playwright.
* Use HTML parsing for known Shopify themes, avoiding headless browsers.

### 3. Image Deduplication + Caching

* Cache identical size chart images across products.
* Extract once and re-use OCR results, reducing redundant processing.

### 4. Serverless or Autoscaling Infrastructure

* Use serverless (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run) for low-traffic days.
* Deploy horizontal scaling for bulk runs (Kubernetes, Celery + Redis).

### 5. Parallel and Distributed Processing

* Use job queues (Celery, RQ) and async workers.
* Parallelize per-store or per-product scraping using multiprocessing/threading.

### 6. Data Compression and Pruning

* Store data in compressed formats (e.g., Parquet or gzipped JSON).
* Discard stale or unnecessary product history.

## Trade-offs

| **Strategy**                   | **Pros**                   | **Trade-off**                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Avoid Playwright when possible | Faster, cheaper            | May miss JavaScript-rendered charts  |
| Cache OCR results              | Saves compute cost         | Requires deduplication logic         |
| Use serverless architecture    | Pay-per-use, auto-scalable | Cold starts, slower on large batches |
| Use free/cheap proxies         | Reduce cost                | Higher block/ban risk                |

### Conclusion

The system can scale efficiently with proactive cost management. Compute, proxy, and OCR are the key cost centers. With caching, optimized scheduling, and fallbacks to static scraping, the system can support up to **100,000 stores at reasonable monthly cost**, depending on SLA, frequency, and data granularity needs.
